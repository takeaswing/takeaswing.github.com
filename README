#Hello!#
##This is the quite excellent README for takeaswing.github.com##

This is a one-page site that uses Jekyll to pull a lot of tiny files into one! Brilliant, eh? Yes, yes it is.

##How do I run this?##
Oh, dear. You probably have no idea how this works, do you?

Well, I don't know yet, either. Let me design the site; then I'll update the README.

Kapeesh?
